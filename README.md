# Memorise
A basic memory based javascript game.


please note, this game is as of yet, unfinished.

The aim of the game is to find paired cards until all the pairs are found.

The start button initialises the game by unlocking the play board and starting the timer.
As pairs are found they become slightly see through and remain locked in place until the game is reset.
Once all pairs are discovered the game ends and a congratulations banner appears.

Languages used in this project: HTML, SCSS, JavaScript.

This project proved particularly challenging for myself and I'm pleased with what i have managed to produce.

Still to do:
  -Finish the pair function.
  -Test the game end function.
  -Fix the issues with the timer.
  
Future additions:
  -Difficulty changes.
  -race the clock mode.
